                <p class = "about">My name is Junlong Zhang, I am a senior at MSU and may major is Games and Interactive Media. I usually like playing games, listening to music, and playing drums. My favorite game types are FPS, RPG and TBS. In addition to that, I also like to study the connection between the game story and the gameplay, as well as the relationship between the characters in the story and the player's reaction/interaction to the game characters.
                    This website is made by myself, it can display some of my personal works and my contact information.
                    Thanks for reading this far!

                <p><div class="img-container01"></div>Bubble Bobble is a 2D platform game developed by Taito and released on June 16, 1986.
                    In the gameplay, players need to control the character to move on a 2D map, avoid and attack the enemy by pressing attack key and jump key. When the enemy on the map is cleaned up, the player will automatically enter the next level. The gameplay is interesting to me, and the attack method fits the name of the game; when the player presses the attack key, a bubble will be shot out, and the enemy touched by the bubble will be wrapped and brought by the bubbles; when the player attacks the enemy again, the enemy will fall on the ground and become fruits. Players can get fruits to earn score rewards.

                <p><div class="img-container05"></div>Satisfactory is a exploration and construction game, the main gameplay is that use the resources of the open map to build a production line to obtain advanced materials and equipment. This game was released on 19 March 2019 in Epic store and 8 June 2020 in Steam; I played it in Steam.

                <p><div class="img-container06"></div>The game can be separated into three parts: exploration, collection, and construction. The map is large, and exploring the entire map can take quite a while. As players explore, players can encounter a variety of ecosystems, each with its own feature. There are some aggressive animals and plants hiding in these environments, as well as animals with gentle personalities. During the exploration, players need to collect resources on the map for their own use: Players can choose to collect and make most of the materials by hand, or they can choose to make materials by machine. "Making" can be subdivided into two parts: building machines out of materials and building materials out of machines; Players use the materials they collect to produce more advanced materials or to build machines for automated production. I think this part is the most interesting to me.
